# Project Overview:
This project is a 2D game focused on helping others while building your own path to success. The player and their friends start a small service to earn money by assisting people in need. Players explore different areas, find characters who require help, and complete tasks to build their reputation and income.

As the game progresses, players can level up their friends, improve their skills, and send them on quests to earn additional money and rewards. Earnings can be used to upgrade and expand the main base, unlocking new features. The game is about character progression.
